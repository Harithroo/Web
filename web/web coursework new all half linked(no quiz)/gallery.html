		<p id="Data" class=dis>Tony Stark initially sees Ultron as a form of A.I. that could keep peace on a global scale, essentially acting as a suit of armor around the whole world, protecting it from large scale threats like the Chitauri. However, he is unable to complete it until he discovers a living computer system inside of Loki's Scepter. Working in secret with Bruce Banner, Stark uses this newly discovered artificial intelligence to finish his defense program. When Ultron wakes up, though, he finds his creators lacking. He instantly makes moves to wipe the Avengers—and most of humanity—off the map, to evolve life on the planet to the next step</p>

Mostly unaware of his father’s troubles, Eddie befriended Parker’s son, the slightly younger Peter. When both sets of parents were killed in a tragic plane crash, Eddie went to live with his grandparents and lost contact with Peter for years. Eddie’s grandfather eventually gave him a frozen sample of the Suit, hidden away by Ed Brock Sr. Eddie threw himself into a study of his father’s work, seeing it as a way to connect with his lost parent. This pursuit eventually led him to Empire State University and a close relationship with Doctor Curt Conners, who helped Eddie study the Suit</p>";
